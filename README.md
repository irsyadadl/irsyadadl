Let's start living like no one can help us in any event, so that when we are helped in certain times, it becomes a plus in itself. I'm teaching practical screencast over on [Parsinta](https://parsinta.com) or [Karteil](https://karteil.com) if you are not visual learner. I also write the package for react icons, you find it [here](https://irsyad.co/paranoid).

You can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/irsyadadl), and sometime on [facebook](https://facebook.com/irsyadadl). I've just released my first book.  If you don't mind, please read it over on [Parsinta](https://parsinta.com/ebooks). If you like my work, you can hit [sponsor button](https://github.com/sponsors/irsyadadl), or donate me on [Saweria](https://saweria.co/irsyadadl).
